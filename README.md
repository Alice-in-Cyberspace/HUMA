Topic: Informing Your Community

A Public Service Announcement (PSA) in .PDF format that includes a QR Code linking to a reliable source for more information on Privacy Settings for Social Media accounts relating to Access Permissions, Data Collecting, Activity Sharing, and Mobile Device Setting, aspects which the PSA aims to bring more community awareness around. 

Closed Captions (CC): “Attention – this is a public service announcement: Do you ever feel like your phone is reading your mind? Were you not just thinking about cat litter? Oh... that’s right, you were asking Alexa to add it for you, and using the microphone, she listened, added it, and then turned around and told a whole bunch of people, trying to sell cat litter, where to find you…  

And here you are. Caught. Red handed. Already on your couch, in your jammies, waiting for commercials to end, wondering if your phone is reading your mind. 

*AI isn’t taking over the world, and you DON’T have to let it take over yours*. 

Scan the QR Code in the PSA Flyer Now for tips on how to be more anti-social on social media and your privacy online.”
